This is a webpage that uses the Giphy API to display 10 animated gifs of whichever animal you wish to display on the main screen. 

By default, a number of animals will already be on display. Enter in the name of the animal you want to add onto the display into the input box and click submit.

Once an animal is added to the display, it gets its own button to click on at the top part of the screen. Clicking the button re-opens the display with 10 gifs of that particular animal.
